## ASO (App Store Optimization) Tips

### Pre-Launch
1. Research competitor keywords (News apps, Positive news apps)
2. A/B test app icon variations if possible
3. Prepare 5 compelling screenshots with captions
4. Write engaging App Preview video script (optional but recommended)

### Post-Launch
1. Monitor keyword rankings weekly
2. Respond to all user reviews (especially first 50)
3. Update keywords based on search performance
4. Iterate on screenshots based on conversion data
5. Add localized metadata for top markets

### Conversion Optimization
- **Icon:** Bright, recognizable, conveys "sun/positivity"
- **Screenshots:** Show core value (curated feed, submission, popular)
- **Description:** Lead with benefit ("Start each day uplifted"), not features
- **Reviews:** Encourage happy users to leave reviews (in-app prompt after 3 days)

## Common Rejection Reasons (and How to Avoid)

### 1. Incomplete Information
**Issue:** Missing demo account, broken support URL, incomplete privacy policy
**Prevention:** Test all URLs, verify demo account works, ensure privacy policy is detailed

### 2. Crashes or Bugs
**Issue:** App crashes during review, features don't work
**Prevention:** Extensive TestFlight testing, QA on multiple devices, test demo account flow

### 3. Privacy Violations
**Issue:** Data collection not disclosed, privacy policy incomplete
**Prevention:** Accurate App Privacy questionnaire, comprehensive privacy policy, minimal data collection

### 4. User-Generated Content
**Issue:** No moderation for user submissions
**Prevention:** Clearly document moderation process in Review Notes, implement reporting/flagging

### 5. Push Notification Issues
**Issue:** Unsolicited notifications, no opt-in, broken APNs
**Prevention:** Optional notifications, soft-ask permission, test on physical device

### 6. Metadata Mismatch
**Issue:** Screenshots show features not in app, description promises undelivered functionality
**Prevention:** Ensure screenshots/description match current build exactly
